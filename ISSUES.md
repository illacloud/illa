# How to file an issue

We encourage you to ask for help whenever you think it's needed! We are happy about every question we get because it allows us to better understand your needs, possible misunderstandings, and most importantly a way for you to help us make ILLA Builder better. That being said, this document's main purpose is to provide guidelines at how you can report a bug or propose a feature request. 

## Filing issues

Whether you are trying to report a bug or propose a feature request, [Github issues](https://github.com/illa-family/illa/issues) is for you!

The `bug report` and `feature request` issue template are ready for you!

## The issue life-cycle

1. User files an issue.
2. The member of `illa family` provides feedback as soon as possible.
3. A conversation or discussion between `illa family` and user.
4. A pull request related to the issue will close it.
5. Otherwise, we'll close the issue after five days of no update.
