# How to file an issue

We encourage you to ask for help whenever you think it's needed! We are happy about every question we get because it allows us to better understand your needs, possible misunderstandings, and most importantly a way for you to help us improve `ILLA Builder`. That being said, this document's main purpose is to provide guidelines on how you can report a bug or propose a feature request.

## Filing issues

Whether you are trying to report a bug or propose a feature request, [Github issues](https://github.com/illa-family/illa/issues) is for you!

The `bug report` and `feature request` issue templates are ready for you!

## The issue life-cycle

1. User files an issue.
2. The `illa cloud` member provides feedback as soon as possible.
3. A conversation or discussion between `illa cloud` and the user.
4. A pull request related to the issue will close it.
5. Otherwise, we'll close the issue after seven days of no update.
